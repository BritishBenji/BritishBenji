<h3> Who am I? What do I do?</h3>

I'm mainly an amatuer python programmer, mainly working with [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) (which you'll find most, if not all, of my projects written with.)
I also like to dabble with things like HTML, JavaScript, and CSS in my free time.  

If you have any questions about any of my repositories, or would like to chat about bot development as a newbie to the scene, feel free to contact me on my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/qBq2WSsgvv)
